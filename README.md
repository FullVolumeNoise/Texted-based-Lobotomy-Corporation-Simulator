# Texted-based-Lobotomy-Corporation-Simulator
Attempting to convert Lobotomy Corporation to a text-based game made in Java.

Lobotomy Corporation is a 2D rogue-lite strategy management simulation game developed by Project Moon. I loved playing the game so I figured I'd try to convert it into a simplified text-based management game similar to Orgeon Trail. 

## Planned Features
- All abnormalities from the original game
- Daily work cycle of sending agents in to harvest energy from abnormalities via various work types
- Departments
- Agents are randomly generated and cost LOB to create
- Agents can panic and/or die
- Users can navigate and act using text input
